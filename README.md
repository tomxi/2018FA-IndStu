# 2018FA-IndStu
Independent Study With Brian McFee Fall 2018

The overall agenda is to make a simple instrument detector that is capabale of doing *real time* classification. This would require the development of a new python tool that could preprocess audio data in a streaming fashion.

Deliverables:

1) Real time instrument classifier in Python
2) Proof-of-concept Python framework for real time audio processing
